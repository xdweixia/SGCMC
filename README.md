## Self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network For Multi-view Clustering

Simple Tensorflow implementation of our [TMM paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9472979) on large-scale HARR dataset.


### Requirements
- Tensorflow 1.13.1
- Python 3.6
- The HARR dataset [HARR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UBONG3kS_HJEy_N0wYQsxzdOMCsZ3vif/view?usp=sharing)
- Put the DOWNLOAD data 'X2.mat' and "data" in the folder "2021-TMM-SGCMC"
